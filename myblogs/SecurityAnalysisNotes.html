				<h3>The Scope and Limitations of Security Analysis. the Concept of Intrinsic Value</h3>
				<p>Instead of providing an accurate number of an issue's "actual" market price (i.e. its intrinsic value), security analysis aims to provide a judgement on whether the current market price is justifiable based on intrinsic value factors. It provides a rough range of the issue's intrinsic value, if the current market price is less than the lower bound of the range then it's attractive and we should buy it; if the market price is greater than the upper bound of the range, then ths issue is inattractive and we should sell it if we own the issue. If the market price is within the range then we should not do any action on this issue.</p>
				<p>The following figure presents the relationship between intrinsic value factors and the market price:</p>
				<img src="../pictures/SecurityAnalysis-Chapter1-1.jpg" width="50%">
				<p>From the above figure we can see that intrinsic value factors (or intrinsic value) don't determine the market price. There are other factors that constitute to the market price. These factors are out of the scope of security analysis. And security analysis has the following limitations:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Inadequate or Incorrect Data: chances are that the intrinsic value factor values may not be accurate. Even though rules and regulations help prevent such cases from happening, we still need to learn to detect such anomalies.</li>
					<li>Uncertainties of the Future: anything can happen in the future, renovations can take place, new bills may be enacted. These things can change the intrinsic value. But it takes time to let the intrinsic value factors to reflect the impact of theses future changes.</li>
					<li>The Irrational Behaviour of the Market: Not everyone uses the same method to invest. Therefore, people make decisions based on different kinds of factors, which makes the market active and somewhat irrational.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Based on the above limitations, security analysis is not a wonder drug, but another rational way to approach the market. Proper usage of rational techniques can make you more likely to win profit. But if luck is the dominant factor of the game then analysis is not so helpful as one may expect. That is why the authors said that security analysis techique is more useful when applied to senior securities (which are protected against change) than to common stocks; more useful when applied to a business of inherently stable character than to one subject to wide variations; more useful when carried on under fairly normal general conditions than in times of great uncertainty and radical change.</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h3>Fundamental Elements in the Problem of Analysis. Quantitative and Qualitative Factors</h3>
				<p>The object of security analysis is to answer, or assist in answering this fundamental question: Should security S be bought or sold or retained at price P, at time T by individual I? Security, price, time and person constitute the fundamental elements in the problem of analysis. Different people are suitable for different securities based on their risk tolerance abilities and their financial conditions; A security of the same price may be attractive at time T1 but unattractive at time T2 due to changes happened during T1 and T2; The price of the security maybe higher its intrinsic value so we should not buy it, or lower than its intrinsic value so it becomes attractive.</p>
				<p>As for the security, we can analyze it using quantitative or qualitative elements. Quantitative factors include: (1) capitalization, (2) earnings and dividends, (3) assets and liabilities, and (4) operating statistics. Qualitative factors include: (1) nature of the business, (2) the relative position of the individual compant in the industry, (3) its physical, geographical, and operating characteristics, (4) the character of the management, (5) its future prospects, which include the projected trend and inherent stability.</p>
			</div>
			<!-- Chapter Three -->
			<div>
				<h3>Sources of Information</h3>
				<p>Here is a list of more important sources of information we need to have:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Data on the terms of the issue</li>
					<li>Data on the company. The annual income account is not resonably complete unless it contains the following items: (1) sales, (2) net earnings (before the items following), (3) depreciation (and depletion), (4) interest charges, (5) non-operating income (in detail), (6) income taxes, (7) dividends paid, (8) surplis adjusements (in detail). The following items are also preferred:
						<ul>
							<li>Production and sales in units. Rate of capacity operated.</li>
							<li>Division of sales as between:
								<ul>
									<li>Domestic and foreign</li>
									<li>Intercompany and outsiders</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Details of operating expenses:
								<ul>
									<li>Wages, wage rates, and number of employees</li>
									<li>State and local taxes paid</li>
									<li>Selling and general expense</li>
									<li>Maintenance expenditures, amount and details</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Details of capital expenditures during the year</li>
							<li>Details of inventories</li>
							<li>Details of properties owned</li>
							<li>Number of stockholders</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Information regarding the industry</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Distinctions Between Investment and Speculation</h3>
				<p>An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and a satisfactory return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.</p>
				<p>An investment operation is also one that can be justified on both qualitative and quantitative grounds.</p>
				<p>Here is an example: In December 1934, General Electric Special (i.e. Preferred) stock was sold at $12.75 per share. It paid a 6% annual dividend yield on $10 par value (i.e. you will receive a dividend of 6% * 10 = 0.6 per share per year if you own this stock). This stock can be redeemed by the company on any dividend date at $11. If you wanted to buy the stock in December 1943, you are speculating $1.75 per share because anytime in the future the stock may be called by the company at $11, you may lose $1.75 per share. You are essentially gambling that the stock will not be redeemed before you sell your share. In the same month, the company announced that it would redeem the stock on April 15, 1935. After the announcement, the price of this stock declined to $11 per share. This time you could buy this stock, wait until it was redeemed and earn the dividend. Your profit is guaranteed and you don't need to worry about the fluctuation of the price. In fact, you could actually borrow money at an interest that would not eat up your profit to maximize what you can earn.</p>
				<p>Types of Investment:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Business investment: Money put or held in a business.</li>
					<li>Financial investment or investment generally: money put or held in securities generally.</li>
					<li>Sheltered investment: money put or held in securities regarded as subject to small risk by reason of their prior claim on earnings or because they rest upon an adequate taxing power (e.g. Certificate of Deposit, Savings Account).</li>
					<li>Analyst's investment: referring to operations that, upon thorough study, promise safety of principal and a satisfactory return. This is the investment we would like to have.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Types of Speculation:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Intelligent speculation: The taking of a risk that appears justified after careful weighing of the pros and cons.</li>
					<li>Risk taking without adequate study of the situation.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The intrinsic value range of an issue contains all of investment component (i.e. investment value) and may contain speculative component (i.e. speculative value).

				<h3>Classification of Securities</h3>
				<p>Securities are customarily divided into the two main groups of bonds and stocks, with the latter subdivided into preferred stocks and common stocks.</p>
				<p>Standard patterns of securities are as follows:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>bond pattern:
						<ul>
							<li>the unqualified right to a fixed interest payment on fixed dates</li>
							<li>the unqualified right to repayment of a fixed principal amount on a fixed date</li>
							<li>no further interest in assets or profits, and no voice in the management</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>preferred-stock pattern:
						<ul>
							<li>a stated rate of dividend in priority to any payment on the common. (Hence full preferred dividends are mandatory if the common receives any dividend; but if nothing is paid on the common, the preferred dividend is subject to the discretion of the directors).</li>
							<li>the right to a stated principal amount in the event of dissolution, in priority to any payments to the common stock.</li>
							<li>either no voting rights, or voting power shared with the common.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>common-stock pattern:
						<ul>
							<li>a pro rata ownership of the company's assets in excess of its debts and preferred stock issues</li>
							<li>a pro rata interest in all profits in excess of prior deductions.</li>
							<li>a pro rata vote for the election of directors and for other purposes.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Bonds and preferred stocks conforming to the above standard patterns will sometimes be referred to as straight bonds or straight preferred stocks.</p>
				<p>The authors suggest the securities be classified under the following three headings:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Class I: Securities of the fixed-value type. <=> A high-grade bond or preferred stock.</li>
					<li>Class II: Senior securities of the variable-value (speculative) type.
						<ul>
							<li>A. well-protected issues with profit possibilities <=> a high-grade convertible bond.</li>
							<li>B. inadequately protected issues <=> a lower-grade bond or preferred stock.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Class III: common-stock type <=> a common stock</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Theory of Common-Stock Investment. The Dividend Factor</h2>
			<!-- Chapter Twenty-seven -->
			<div>
				<h3>The Theory of Common-Stock Investment</h3>
				<p>In the past (i.e. pre World War I era), a common stock having the following attributes was considered investment:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A suitable and established dividend return: the company paid continued dividends and the amount was satisfaying. One can at least earn stalbe dividends from the stock, which makes it safe to invest.</li>
					<li>A stable and adequate earnings record: the company's earnings per share was stable and averaged substantially in excess of the dividends paid. This could help determine that we can have a stable divendend return in the future. And the stock becomes attractive when the price is not too high.</li>
					<li>A satisfactory backing of tangible assets: (actual amount of money invested in the company's own business / (market value of a stock * total number of its stocks)) is greater than 1, meaning that each dollar of stock corresponds to a dollar or more of actual investment in the business. This makes sure the price is not too high and there is a chance of capital gain apart from earning dividends. It also shows that the company is commited to its business and makes it more likely to maintain its earning power.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Buying common-stock based on other attributes in the pre World War I era was considered speculative. But during the post World War I period, people changed their opinion and thought that "The value of a common stock depends entirely upon what it will earn in the future", meaning that buying common stocks from a company that shows an upward trend of earnings per share was considered investment. There were two reasons for this shift:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Stable dividend returns or stable earnings could not guarantee that the future dividend returns or earnings would be the same as in the past.</li>
					<li>The actual investment in the business could not determine the future earnings. And the future earnings depended entirely upon a favorable industrial position and upon capable or fortunate managerial polices.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>However, this new-era theory was speculative because it was essentially betting that the company would maintain its growing trend in its earnings per share ragardless of the how much dividend you could get, whereas using the pre Word War I theory one could at least earn stable dividend returns from the stock. And the new-era theory did not take into the account the current market price of the stock. One may purchase a stock at a price well over its intrinsic value. The dangerous part of this theory was that the earning trend was a projected trend which may not be true. This makes this speculative operation more risky.</p>
			</div>

			<!-- Chapter Twenty-eight -->
			<div>
				<h3>Newer Canons of Common-Stock Investment</h3>
				<p>In the previous chapter, the authors determined that the theory to buy common stocks based on the trend of earnings is speculative and risky. However, the danger of applying this theory lies in the fact that people use the trend of earnings as the only criterion when buying common stocks in all cases. This theory can be useful in each of the following conditions:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Our country's wealth and earning power will increase secularly, such increase will reflect itself in the increased resources and profits of our important corporations, and the corporations will use the surplus to invest or reinvest in the business to guarantee future earning power. That means the trend of earnings approach will work if the country's economy is booming.</li>
					<li>There are companies that not only grow when the general environment is good, but also grow amid economic depression (i.e. the growth trend may be interrupted, but the company end up earning more before the crisis). Look for those companies and make sure they will still possess the trend by checking if the companies are still innovative enough to lead or keep up in the game.</li>
					<li>We filter the stocks based on Margin-of-safety principle. This means buying the stock when it is selling below its minimum intrinsic value measured by the analyst. To apply this principle there are two techniques:
						<ul>
							<li>Buy the selected stock at times when the general market is low, measured by quantitative standards of value. The easiest way of doing this is to get the market index's past index figure and draw a line approximately at the mid-point of the swing index numbers. Buy the stocks on your list when the index number is at some percentage below the line and sell your stocks when the index number is at some percentage above the line. One can also use the following more complicated system:
								<ul>
									<li>Select a diversified list of leading industrial common stocks.</li>
									<li>Determine a base or "normal" value for the grpup by capitalizing their average earnings per share at some suitable figure, related to the going long-term interest rate. One should end up plotting the average earnings per share curve and the long-term interest rate curve to find an interception where any value below this point means the general market is low, and any value higher means the general market is high.</li>
									<li>Determine a buying point at some percentage below this normal value and a selling point above it.</li>
								</ul>
								The limits of this system are that the buying and selling points can be badly chosen so that one miss the opportunity to buy or sell; there is a chance that the market behaves drastically differently that normal value changes but we don't have enough data to update so that we cannot use this method; thie method requires buying and selling when the market favors the opposite direction, watching the shares go lower after purchase and higher after sale and often staying out of the market for long periods when most people are actively interested in stocks. If one is temperamentally qualified then one can use this strategy.
							</li>
							<li>Because the stock market emphasizes on the growth factor, quite a number of enterprises that are long established, well financed, important in their industries and persumably destined to stay in business and make profits indefinitely in the future, but that have no speculative or growth appeal, tend to be discriminated against by the stock market especially in years of subnotmal profits and to sell for considerably less than the business would be worth to a private owner. Buy the stock at this stage and wait for its price to return to normal. To use this method we need to figure how to evaluate the company's value from the perspective of a private owner.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>The Dividend Factor in Common-Stock Investment</h3>
				<p>Companies pay dividend to shareholders in return for their investments. Some companies may think that they are going to keep most of the earnings to reinvest to grow the company instead of giving out most of their earnings to the shareholders. This is called a conservative dividend policy. In some cases the company end up habing higher earnings and paying the stockholders more dividend in the end. And the prices of their stocks are actually lower than what they should be because the market favors companies that pay more dividends if they have the same earning power. But most of the time, the stockholders end up earning more from the companies paying more dividends because:
				<ol>
					<li>the companies that reinvest most of their profits fail to gain proportionate earning power or</li>
					<li>the companies are simply using these profits to protect the business from going bankrupt</li>
				</ol>
				</p>
				<p>As a stockholder, you want the company to reinvest to grow so you can have greater capital gain from your stocks, but you also want to earn as much dividend as you can from the company you invest. So you need to justify whether the company is worth your money. You can build a relative model to see if the market price is reasonable given a company's earnings per share and dividend rate. For example, if a common stock A earns $7 and pays $5 should sell at $100 (i.e. having a earning ratio of 7% and a dividend yield of 5%), then common stock B earning $7 buy pays $4 should sell at a price range between $80 (to have a dividend yield of 5%) and $100 (to have a earning ratio of 7%). In general the price should tend to be established nearer to the lower limit than to the upper limit, so if the earning power of the company does not go above the standard you should not invest in this stock. But if you earn more dividend than the standard you can expect the company's earning power to be a little bit lower than the standard and you are justified to pay a price higher than the stadard (e.g. stock C earning $7 and pays $6 should sell at a range between 100 to 120 based on the aforementioned "standard").</p>

				<h3>Stock Dividends</h3>
				<p>Dividends can be distributed by means of stocks. There are two types of stock dividends:
					<ul>
						<li>Extraordinary Stock Dividends/Split-ups: Companies do this to lower the price and attract more buyers.</li>
						<li>Periodic Stock Dividends: Additional shares of stocks are given periodically. The dividend rate will increase and the stock may enjoy a higher market value than similar stocks not paying such dividends.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

			<h2>Analysis of the Income Account. The Earnings Factor in Common-Stock Valuation</h2>
			<!-- Chapter Thirty-one -->
			<div>
				<h3>Analysis of the Income Account</h3>
				<p>To evaluate the earning power of a company, at least we need to know about the earnings per share of the company. It may be very easy nowadays to get the earnings per share value, but this value may not be accurate because the company can arbitrarily determine what to put into the income account and what not to put to make the numbers look great. So we need to study the income account to try to dig out what is closer to the real situation. Here is what we need to figure out from an income account:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The accounting aspect: what are the true earnings for the period studied?</li>
					<li>The business aspect: what indications does the earnings record carry as to the future earning power of the company? (viz. we need to determine whether these past records are good indicators for the future)</li>
					<li>The aspect of investment finance: what elements in the earnings exhibit must be taken into account, and what standards followed, in endeavoring to arrive at a reasonable valuation of the shares?</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The first thing we need to do is to remove the nonrecurrent profits or losses from the earnings (i.e. deduct non-recurring profits from income and add non-recurring losses to income). Here are the major items we would like to look for and take out from the earnings:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Profits from sale of fixed assets</li>
					<li>Profits from sale of marketable securities</li>
					<li>Profits from repurchase of senior securities at a discount</li>
					<li>Other nonrecurrent items (e.g. proceeds of life insurance policies, tax refunds, gain or loss as result of ligitation, extraordinary write-downs of inventory, extraordinary write-downs of receivables, cost of maintaning nonoperating properties, etc.)</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<!-- Chapter Thirty-two -->
			<div>
				<h3>Extraordinary Losses and Other Special Items in the Income Account</h3>
				<p>This chapter discusses about the types of non-recurring losses we need to take out from the earning account: extraordinary write-downs of inventory, extraordinary write-downs of receivables, and amortization of bond discount (having a bond discount means the company needs to pay back the bond holder more money than it received apart from interest).</p>
				<p>Inventory losses can be used to manufacture earnings. This can be done by deducting a sum of money from the surplus from the last report and writing down the inventory value to inflate the profit. When they are sold out in the next period, the company receives the revenue as if the value of inventories has not been written down, that results in a higher profit number in the next report. This may be difficult to detect but we need to restate the income account if we detect such issues. Another way of doing this is to deduct a sum of money from the earnings and put this money to a reserve. Charge the reserve when an inventory loss happens to absorb the loss. That means the profit is understated in the previous report and overstated in the next report. We need to eliminate the reserves and deduct the inventory loss from the yaer in which the company sustained.</p>
				<p>Even if these cover ups for inventory loss do not occur. We still need to know that there are the following two legitimate ways to make the profit numbers look better when doing inventory accounting:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Last in, first out method: Items bought the latest were sold the earliest in the accounting period instead of being sold the latest. Note that if the items bought the earliest were sold the earliest the accounting method is called "first in, first out".</li>
					<li>Normal-stock/Basic-stock/Average cost method: the unit cost of the entire accounting period will be the average of the unit cost of each time items were purchased.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>As for idle-plant expense, this cost of non-operating properties was seen charaged against income most of the time. This cost is actually non-recurring and we should take out if seen charged from income.</p>
				<p>There is a type of expenses that a company does not need to pay for during the current accounting period but needs to pay during the comming periods. This type of expenses (which could be organizational expense (legal fees, etc.), moving expenses, development expenses (for new products or processes, also for opening up a mine, etc.) and discount on obligations sold) is called Deferred Charge. This type of charge is charged against earnings but it can be spread out in a number of years to make the profit numbers look good. This is also a non-recurring loss.</p>
				<p>Amortization of bond discount is charged against earnings or surplus in a good earning period to prevent future deductions due to bond discount to make the shares more "valuable". This is apparently non-recurring loss.</p>
			</div>

			<!-- Chapter Thirty-three -->
			<div>
				<h3>Misleading Artifices in the Income Account. Earnings of Subsidiaries</h3>
				<p>On rare occasions, some companies may choose to add items in earnings that are not existent. To check whether a company has done such things, one can use the amount of federal tax paid by the company to estimate the amount of earnings and see if there is a large discrepancy between the estimated earnings and the reported earnings. We should avoid these companies once we find such discrepancies because the management is bad to let this happen.</p>
				<p>Companies may have subsidiaries/divisions. For the earnings of subsidiaries, the authors suggest the following treatment:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>In the first place, subsidiary losses are to be deducted in every analysis.</li>
					<li>If the amount involved is significant, the analyst should investigate whether or not the losss may be subject to early termination.</li>
					<li>If the result of this examination is favorable (i.e. the company is very likely to terminate the subsidiary in the future), the analyst may consider all or part of the subsidiary's loss as the equivalent of a nonrecurring item.</li>
				</ul>
