				<h3>The Scope and Limitations of Security Analysis. the Concept of Intrinsic Value</h3>

				<p>Instead of providing an accurate number of an issue's "actual" market price (i.e. its intrinsic value), security analysis aims to provide a judgement on whether the current market price is justifiable based on intrinsic value factors. It provides a rough range of the issue's intrinsic value, if the current market price is less than the lower bound of the range then it's attractive and we should buy it; if the market price is greater than the upper bound of the range, then ths issue is inattractive and we should sell it if we own the issue. If the market price is within the range then we should not do any action on this issue.</p>

				<p>The following figure presents the relationship between intrinsic value factors and the market price:</p>
				<img src="../pictures/SecurityAnalysis-Chapter1-1.jpg" width="50%">

				<p>From the above figure we can see that intrinsic value factors (or intrinsic value) don't determine the market price. There are other factors that constitute to the market price. These factors are out of the scope of security analysis. And security analysis has the following limitations:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Inadequate or Incorrect Data: chances are that the intrinsic value factor values may not be accurate. Even though rules and regulations help prevent such cases from happening, we still need to learn to detect such anomalies.</li>
					<li>Uncertainties of the Future: anything can happen in the future, renovations can take place, new bills may be enacted. These things can change the intrinsic value. But it takes time to let the intrinsic value factors to reflect the impact of theses future changes.</li>
					<li>The Irrational Behaviour of the Market: Not everyone uses the same method to invest. Therefore, people make decisions based on different kinds of factors, which makes the market active and somewhat irrational.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Based on the above limitations, security analysis is not a wonder drug, but another rational way to approach the market. Proper usage of rational techniques can make you more likely to win profit. But if luck is the dominant factor of the game then analysis is not so helpful as one may expect. That is why the authors said that security analysis techique is more useful when applied to senior securities (which are protected against change) than to common stocks; more useful when applied to a business of inherently stable character than to one subject to wide variations; more useful when carried on under fairly normal general conditions than in times of great uncertainty and radical change.</p>

				<h3>Fundamental Elements in the Problem of Analysis. Quantitative and Qualitative Factors</h3>

				<p>The object of security analysis is to answer, or assist in answering this fundamental question: Should security S be bought or sold or retained at price P, at time T by individual I? Security, price, time and person constitute the fundamental elements in the problem of analysis. Different people are suitable for different securities based on their risk tolerance abilities and their financial conditions; A security of the same price may be attractive at time T1 but unattractive at time T2 due to changes happened during T1 and T2; The price of the security maybe higher its intrinsic value so we should not buy it, or lower than its intrinsic value so it becomes attractive.</p>

				<p>As for the security, we can analyze it using quantitative or qualitative elements. Quantitative factors include: (1) capitalization, (2) earnings and dividends, (3) assets and liabilities, and (4) operating statistics. Qualitative factors include: (1) nature of the business, (2) the relative position of the individual compant in the industry, (3) its physical, geographical, and operating characteristics, (4) the character of the management, (5) its future prospects, which include the projected trend and inherent stability.</p>

				<h3>Sources of Information</h3>

				<p>Here is a list of more important sources of information we need to have:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Data on the terms of the issue</li>
					<li>Data on the company. The annual income account is not resonably complete unless it contains the following items: (1) sales, (2) net earnings (before the items following), (3) depreciation (and depletion), (4) interest charges, (5) non-operating income (in detail), (6) income taxes, (7) dividends paid, (8) surplis adjusements (in detail). The following items are also preferred:
						<ul>
							<li>Production and sales in units. Rate of capacity operated.</li>
							<li>Division of sales as between:
								<ul>
									<li>Domestic and foreign</li>
									<li>Intercompany and outsiders</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Details of operating expenses:
								<ul>
									<li>Wages, wage rates, and number of employees</li>
									<li>State and local taxes paid</li>
									<li>Selling and general expense</li>
									<li>Maintenance expenditures, amount and details</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Details of capital expenditures during the year</li>
							<li>Details of inventories</li>
							<li>Details of properties owned</li>
							<li>Number of stockholders</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Information regarding the industry</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Distinctions Between Investment and Speculation</h3>

				<p>An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and a satisfactory return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.</p>

				<p>An investment operation is also one that can be justified on both qualitative and quantitative grounds.</p>

				<p>Here is an example: In December 1934, General Electric Special (i.e. Preferred) stock was sold at $12.75 per share. It paid a 6% annual dividend yield on $10 par value (i.e. you will receive a dividend of 6% * 10 = 0.6 per share per year if you own this stock). This stock can be redeemed by the company on any dividend date at $11. If you wanted to buy the stock in December 1943, you are speculating $1.75 per share because anytime in the future the stock may be called by the company at $11, you may lose $1.75 per share. You are essentially gambling that the stock will not be redeemed before you sell your share. In the same month, the company announced that it would redeem the stock on April 15, 1935. After the announcement, the price of this stock declined to $11 per share. This time you could buy this stock, wait until it was redeemed and earn the dividend. Your profit is guaranteed and you don't need to worry about the fluctuation of the price. In fact, you could actually borrow money at an interest that would not eat up your profit to maximize what you can earn.</p>

				<p>Types of Investment:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Business investment: Money put or held in a business.</li>
					<li>Financial investment or investment generally: money put or held in securities generally.</li>
					<li>Sheltered investment: money put or held in securities regarded as subject to small risk by reason of their prior claim on earnings or because they rest upon an adequate taxing power (e.g. Certificate of Deposit, Savings Account).</li>
					<li>Analyst's investment: referring to operations that, upon thorough study, promise safety of principal and a satisfactory return. This is the investment we would like to have.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Types of Speculation:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Intelligent speculation: The taking of a risk that appears justified after careful weighing of the pros and cons.</li>
					<li>Risk taking without adequate study of the situation.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The intrinsic value range of an issue contains all of investment component (i.e. investment value) and may contain speculative component (i.e. speculative value).

				<h3>Classification of Securities</h3>

				<p>Securities are customarily divided into the two main groups of bonds and stocks, with the latter subdivided into preferred stocks and common stocks.</p>

				<p>Standard patterns of securities are as follows:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>bond pattern:
						<ul>
							<li>the unqualified right to a fixed interest payment on fixed dates</li>
							<li>the unqualified right to repayment of a fixed principal amount on a fixed date</li>
							<li>no further interest in assets or profits, and no voice in the management</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>preferred-stock pattern:
						<ul>
							<li>a stated rate of dividend in priority to any payment on the common. (Hence full preferred dividends are mandatory if the common receives any dividend; but if nothing is paid on the common, the preferred dividend is subject to the discretion of the directors).</li>
							<li>the right to a stated principal amount in the event of dissolution, in priority to any payments to the common stock.</li>
							<li>either no voting rights, or voting power shared with the common.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>common-stock pattern:
						<ul>
							<li>a pro rata ownership of the company's assets in excess of its debts and preferred stock issues</li>
							<li>a pro rata interest in all profits in excess of prior deductions.</li>
							<li>a pro rata vote for the election of directors and for other purposes.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Bonds and preferred stocks conforming to the above standard patterns will sometimes be referred to as straight bonds or straight preferred stocks.</p>

				<p>The authors suggest the securities be classified under the following three headings:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Class I: Securities of the fixed-value type. <=> A high-grade bond or preferred stock.</li>
					<li>Class II: Senior securities of the variable-value (speculative) type.
						<ul>
							<li>A. well-protected issues with profit possibilities <=> a high-grade convertible bond.</li>
							<li>B. inadequately protected issues <=> a lower-grade bond or preferred stock.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Class III: common-stock type <=> a common stock</li>
				</ul>
