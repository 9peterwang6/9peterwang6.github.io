    <h4 id="the-three-pillars-of-information-security-is-known-as-the-cia-traid-confidentiality-integrity-and-availablility">The three pillars of information security is known as the CIA Traid: confidentiality, integrity and availablility:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Confidentiality is about keeping your private data secret. Any personal or professional data you don't want to see in the headlines or on websites is private data. Private data should always be kept secret.</li>
      <li>Availability means that the systems you need are run and running properly. It means that you have access to the information and resources you need when you need them.</li>
      <li>Integrity is about accuracy or authenticity. It means that your boss' email is really sent from your boss.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="to-maintain-information-security-we-need-to-figure-out-how-to-maintain-our-cia-traid-in-three-domains-physical-cyber-and-people-domains">To maintain information security, we need to figure out how to maintain our CIA Traid in three domains: Physical, Cyber, and People domains:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>To maintain CIA Traid in the physical domain, we need to protect the physical access of our stuff.</li>
      <li>To maintain CIA Traid in the cyber domain, we need to maintain the network security.</li>
      <li>To maintain CIA Traid in the people domain, we need to watch out for suspicious behaviours from people.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="here-is-a-detailed-list-of-things-we-can-do-when-maintaining-the-cia-traid">Here is a detailed list of things we can do when maintaining the CIA Traid:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Report a potential security incident (i.e. something odd) you come across.</li>
      <li>Use strong passwords:
<ul><li>follow the password traid: symbols, numbers, and mixed-case letters</li><li>create a passphrase or a group of words that make sense toghther and are easy for you to remember. The longer the better, then you can mix in the password traid to make it strong.</li><li>Never use the same password for multiple accounts</li><li>Never write down or store them somewhere obvious</li><li>Never reveal your passwords to anyone</li></ul></li>
      <li>Use antivirus software</li>
      <li>Be a human firewall to check all the information that comes in and out of our computers and our organization:
<ul><li>Connect to HTTPS websites</li><li>Do not give away Personal Indentifiable Information unless absolutely necessary</li><li>Check your privacy settings on your social media</li><li>Double check who exactly you are talking to when using emails</li></ul></li>
      <li>Be aware of social engineering
<ul><li>For Dumpster Diving: use the shredders or secure disposal bins at the office, and get a paper shredder for sensitive personal documents at home</li><li>For Phoce Calls: always verify the identity of the caller before giving out any information. If you're skeptical, call the person back using a known number, such as the number on the back of your credit card, or on the organization's website.</li><li>In person: recognize and report whe nsomeone is doing something out of ordinary or is entering restricted areas without authorization</li><li>Phising: Take the time to examine a message before responding or clicking.</li></ul></li>
      <li>Protect your mobile devices:
<ul><li>Turn off bluetooth and WiFi when not in use. Never connect to public networks without a VPN. Always follow organizational policy regarding WiFi, VPNs and mobile devices.</li><li>Lock your devices via passwords and physical locks</li><li>Verify the source of apps to ensure authenticity</li><li>Update the softwares you use</li><li>Constantly back up your devices</li><li>Never give out any sensitive information unless you know who you are dealing with and under absolute legitimacy</li></ul></li>
